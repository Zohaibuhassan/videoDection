# Video Detection using YOLO

This project implements a real-time **video object detection system** using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** model. It detects and tracks objects across video frames using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLOv5 or YOLOv8) and OpenCV.

---

##  Features

-  Object detection on video frames
-  Real-time processing
-  Supports YOLOv5/YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
-  Optionally extendable with object tracking (e.g., Deep SORT)
-  Works with video files or webcam input

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python 
- [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Google Colab (for development)
